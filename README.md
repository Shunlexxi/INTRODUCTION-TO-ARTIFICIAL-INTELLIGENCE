## Pre-Learning

[Understand what is Azure OpenAI service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview/??wt.mc_id=studentamb_255353) and work through the [Introduction to Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/explore-azure-openai/??wt.mc_id=studentamb_255353) training module.

## Prerequisites

To replicate the demo included in the workshop on your own Azure subscription you'll need to:
1.	Create an Azure Subscription. If you are a student claim your [Azure for Students benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?wt.mc_id=studentamb_255353) (no credit card required), otherwise sign up for an [Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0044p/?wt.mc_id=studentamb_255353).
2.  [Review the limited access policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access?context=%2Fazure%2Fcognitive-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext&?wt.mc_id=studentamb_255353) to Azure OpenAI service.
3.	[Apply for access to the Azure OpenAI Service](https://aka.ms/oai/access)

## What attendees will learn

In this workshop, attendees will learn about how AI has been infused across the whole Microsoft Cloud tech stack and which technological innovations enabled the recent AI revolution. They'll be introduced to the theory about how a large language model (LLM) works and they'll learn more about Azure AI offering and how to choose the cognitive service that best suits their solution requirements. 

## Milestone 1: What's AI and usage?

In this segment, we'll start by introducing what Artificial Intelligence is and the innovations that are revolutionizing the AI landscape and their impact on societies.

[Powerpoint](slides.pptx) and the [Video](https://stdntpartners.sharepoint.com/:v:/s/MSPOpen2/EQ9Vok17OVtBpKUZzU8ZKAUBYKz0AmDmFLsHxgtWmQhAcA?e=rhuVXP&nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJTdHJlYW1XZWJBcHAiLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJTaGFyZURpYWxvZyIsInJlZmVycmFsQXBwUGxhdGZvcm0iOiJXZWIiLCJyZWZlcnJhbE1vZGUiOiJ2aWV3In19"workshop walk-through"))*

## Milestone 2: Timeline and History of AI

Next, we'll revealing the Timeline and History of AI.

## Milestone 3: Key Workloads

Let's deep dive into Key Workloads (or terms you would hear AI Developers uses often). Such as 
1. Machine Learning (ML)
2. Anomaly detection
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
4. Computer vision
5. Knowledge mining

## Milestone 4: Computer Vision

The capability of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
